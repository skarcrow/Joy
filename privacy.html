            <p class="flow-text">Whenever I collect or process your personal data, I’ll only keep it for as long as is
            necessary for the purpose for which it was collected.

            counselling sessions end unless agreed otherwise. Your contact and appointment
            details will be kept for 6 years and then destroyed unless agreed otherwise. Any
            emails, texts, messages or other communications will be deleted after receipt unless
            they form part of your notes or are needed for income tax purposes in which case they
            will be kept for 6 years as above. Your telephone number will be stored on my mobile
            phone only until your sessions end at which point it will be deleted. If I change
            telephones then your details will be deleted on the old phone. All electronic
            information will be securely deleted by a specialist software programme.</p>
